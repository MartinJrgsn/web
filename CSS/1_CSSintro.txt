Cascading Style Sheets

Why was it created and why it's necessary.

Back when the internet was learning to crawl, people used to style their websites with pure HTML. 
As we've seen so far HTML is not a styling language, but a structural tool for a websites backbone.

In order to style my homepage using HTML, we had to write 12 lines of code, which could easily 
have spelling errors, forgotten end tags, or general faulty use of the HTML syntax. The 12 lines 
of code was mostly just to setup tables. This is why people started to use Cascading Style Sheets. 
Although it can't really do anything by itself, its only purpose it to style markup language like 
HTML and XML.

In this section, we will bring my old pure HTML website out of the 1990's, and into current day 
and age.
