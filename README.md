# web

Follow along my journey learning about the internet.

I bought a udemy course:
https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/

From this course I expect, or hope to learn something about:

- how the internet works
- HTML
- Webpage design

I'm also studying computer engineering, on my 2nd. Semester.
Which included a course in databases. I've learned to modell a database, 
through normalization and grouping. Where the end goal is 3NF (third 
Normal Form).

I've also learned some SQL queries.
I am somewhat comfortable writing basic queries, such as:
- CREATE 
	- DATABASE
	- TABLE
- DROP 
	- DATABASE
	- TABLE
- DELETE 
	- COLUMN

- SELECT 
	columnName1.tableName, 
	columnName2.tableName
  FROM
	tableName1 AS alias1, 
	tableName2 AS alias2, 
	.., 
	tableNameN AS aliasN
  WHERE 
  	(something = somethingElse)
  AND
  	(columnName.tableName = columnToJoinNameID.tableName)
  AND
  	(... = ...)

  To avoid ('kartesisk produkt' (NOR)) 'cartesian product' (ENG?).
  
I am on the other hand not too comfortable with UPDATEs, and ecspecially 
correlated / synchronized subqueries. So I would love to learn something
about that aswell.
