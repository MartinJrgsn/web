Head over to codepen.io/pen/ to get in an environment, where you can live preview your HTML code 
snippets. Minimize CSS and Javascript for now.

HTML stands for:
HyperText Markup Language, where Markup is the keyword.

When you want to start of a webpage, you will likely want a title. You can then start with the 
head of the webpage. There are six different levels of titles. 

<h1>h1 would be the biggest title</h1>
<h2>h2 would be the second biggest</h2>
<h3>all the</h3>
<h4>way up</h4>
<h5>to</h5>
<h6>h6</h6>

h6 is therefore the smallest of the heads, anything over (like <h7,8,9,..,n></h7,8,9,..,n>) does 
not exist.

Is a collection of elements for different languages. Under the HTML5 tab, you can scroll down to 
h1	||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
h2	||to again get more information ||

h4	||heads you can use, when       ||

Now, how do we get a new line on our webpage?
Some might be familiar with the '\n' from other high level programming languages, but here we use:
<br>
to get a linebreak. The one thing you might notice, is that compared with other HTML elements, 
<br>
does not require a "end element" (</br>) to function. All you need is the <br>, and a new line 
appears!
