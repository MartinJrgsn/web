What exactly is the internet?

It is basically a long wire, connecting different computers together.
Some of these computers attached to this wire, have a special job. They have to be online 
24/7, ready to serve you the data that you request. These computers are what's called a server.
The computer that are accessing these servers, are called clients.

When you want to access a specific server, like Google. How does the client (your computer) know 
where to go along this long wire?
You type in www.google.com, your browser will send a message to your ISP (Internet Service 
Provider), saying that I want access to google.com. Your ISP will then relay that message to 
something called a DNS Server (Domain Name System Server). A DNS Server is a database that joins 
the domain name with the servers IP address. Once the DNS Server finds Google's IP address, it 
sends that back to your browser, so now your browser knows the exact IP address to find Google's 
server.

running around the world, connecting every client, ISP, DNS Server and server together.

We are familiar with typing in domain names to reach Google's homepage, but what you also can do 
is to type in Google's IP address, which will connect you directly to their homepage. As im typing 
this, their IP address is:

216.58.211.132
