Let's take a look at an easy example of Hello World!

<h1>Hello World!</h1>
 |  ^^^^^^^^^^^   |
 |    content     |
start		 end
tag		 tag

By writing this code, we ask our browser to make the content, Hello World!, into a title for our 
webpage. Our browser understands then that everything between the start tag, and the end tag, is 
required to be presented as the title.

There are also some tags that are self-closing. By this I mean that you do not need to specify the 
end of the tag, for the browser to understand how to handle the function. As an example from 
earlier. To get a newline in your webpage, you need the <br> tag. This tag is a self-closing tag.

How do we find out wether or not to use a end tag?
This is where we use the reference; www.devdocs.io, to investige which tags are self-closing, and 
which tags you have to manually close.

If you take a look under the HTML5 tab, and scroll down to <h3>, you can check the "tag omission" 
in the heading, where it says "None, both the starting and ending tag are mandatory".

Under <br> the tag omission says: "Must have a start tag, and must not have an end tag. ...".

If you would like to incapsulate your <h1>Title</h1>, you can use the <hr> tag before, and after 
the title. This <hr> is commonly reffered to as a horizontal rule. You can edit the size, color 
and shade of this line, to get the desired look of your title display.
If you also combine a <center></center> tag, your title will really start to come together!

<center>
  <hr size="3" noshade>
    <h1>The Adventures of 
    <br>Sherlock Holmes</h1>
    <h3>by</h3>
    <h2>Arthur Conan Doyle</h2>
  <hr size="3" noshade>
</center>

This is the example from the course, which in my own opinion, has a really nice look to it. That 
is even before I've learned anything about CSS. Which perhaps says something about my standards 
for satisfaction.

If you take a look at the horizontal rule tag, you can see there are something inside the tag. 
This is whats called attribute. It gives more information to the browser, that specifies more of 
what we want from the horizontal rule. In the example, L32 and L37, you can see size="3". This 
means that i want the horizontal rule to be in size 3, and not the default size of 2.
