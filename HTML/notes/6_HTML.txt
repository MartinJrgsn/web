The final information regarding the HTML section of this course, can be found under: 
web/webDevelopment/HTML_PersonalSite/*

Start with the index.html file, this is the main site of my homepage. If I had my own domain, this 
is where clients would land firstly. Read the index.html file, look through the code structure, 
look at the comments, and try it yourself.

If you are reading this, and would like to try to create a locally hosted webpage, all you need 
is a computer and a text-editor, such as atom, visual code, vi, vim, notes etc.

Open the filename.html, and start to write. After the code has been saved, you can update your 
browser to see the changes, or if something broke, like faulty syntax.
