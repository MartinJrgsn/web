Install atom from atom.io, or snap install atom --classic

Install all these packages (plugins):
	- atom-beautify
	- atom-ternjs
	- autoclose-html
	- emmet
	- csslint
	- pigments
	- language-ejs

These are optional:
	- atom-html-preview
	- Sublime-Style-Column-Selection
	- linter-eslint

Open atom, open a project folder, preferably one connected to github.

inside that project folder, create a folder called web development
inside that folder, create a folder called HTML - Personal Site (this is where the website will be)
inside the HTML - Personal Site folder, create a new file called index.html

index.html is what most web devs name their homepage.

Since you installed the emmet package, when you've started a new index.html file in atom, you can 
just type html, and hit ENTER. This will bring up a structure, that you have to set up everytime 
you desire to make a website. Using this package, you don't need to remember that whole system!

The head of the webpage holds information about how the browser should handle the webpage.
Under <title></title> in the head of the index.html file, write what the title for the webpage 
should be.

the meta charset should be set to utf-8, when coding HTML5, because this is the standard encoding 
standard. The reason is because it includes all of the international symbols, and in fact every 
symbol that is included in the unicode characterset!

unicode-table.com shows a table of all the unicode characters. Unicode even includes emojis, so if 
you do follow the standard, you get to use emojis on your webpage with utf-8 encoding.

In the <body>, you get to start with the content of the webpage. Since what I'm writing is a 
personal webpage, my level 1 heading, is my name; Martin JÃ¸rgensen. Underneath my name, I have a 
little bit of information about myself. And below that, I've got my education listed.
